# Note Taker Application

## Description

The Note Taker application allows a user to input new to-do tasks and save them to the application, allowing the user to keep track of tasks needing to be completed.
The application uses Express.js as the back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The application connects the written back-end code with the already completed front end and is deployed to Heroku.
